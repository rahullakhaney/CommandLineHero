# What is CLI?

The command line is a text interface for your computer. It's a program that takes user inputs, these inputs are then forwarded to the computer's OS (Operating System) for execution. Using the CLI you can perform numerous tasks with speed and ease.

From the CLI you can navigate through various files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Finder on Mac OS or Windows Explorer on Windows. The difference is that the command line is text-based, much more powerful and rhobust. Some of the biggest advantages are being able to write scripts to automate common tasks and combine simple commands to handle difficult tasks.

In Mac OSX you can access CLI by opening Terminal. Personally i use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) and find it way better than Terminal.

## How to open command line.

To open Terminal on your Mac OSX, go to the Application folder, then open the Utilities folder. Adding it to dock is a good idea. I generally launch Terminal/iTerm by using spotlight search in OSX. 
Just hold onto the command key (âŒ˜) and hit spacebar, enter "Terminal/iTerm".
 

## Before Getting Started.

Let's clarify a few things and terms before we get started.


**Console:** This is the system as a whole. This is both the command line as well as the output from previous commands.

**Command Line:** This is the actual line in a console where you type your commands.

**Prompt:** This is the beginning of the command line. In Terminal/iTerm window we type after the "``` $ ```".

**Terminal:** Interface to the console. The program we use to interact with the console is actually a "terminal emulator".
